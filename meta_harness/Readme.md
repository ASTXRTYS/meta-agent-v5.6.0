## What Is This?

Meta Harness takes a product idea from initial concept through to a **fully built, tested, and evaluated AI application**. It orchestrates a pipeline of seven specialized Deep Agents — from requirements gathering through research, architecture, planning, implementation, and evaluation — with a built-in **optimizer-evaluator feedback loop** that enforces scientific rigor throughout development.

### What Changed from v1 → v2

| Dimension | v1 | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Topology** | PM owns all specialists as subagents | Peer Deep Agent child graphs under a thin LangGraph PCG |
| **Routing** | PM mediates every handoff | Agents route themselves via handoff tool selection; PCG plumbs |
| **State** | Shared PM context window | Per-role checkpoint namespaces under one project thread |
| **Phase Gates** | Implicit in PM logic | Explicit middleware hooks on handoff tools |
| **Specialist Loops** | PM as pass-through | Direct peer-to-peer (Architect↔Researcher, Developer↔HE, etc.) |
| **Agent Count** | 7 (PM, HE, Researcher, Architect, Planner, Developer, Verification) | 7 (PM, HE, Researcher, Architect, Planner, Developer, **Evaluator**) |
| **Handoff Protocol** | Implicit context passing | 20 explicit handoff tools with `reason` enum and middleware gates |

> **Core insight:** If agents are LLMs making conscious decisions about peer communication, routing should live *in the agents*, not in a coordination layer. The coordination layer is plumbing, not a brain.

## Guiding Principles

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🎯 PM Scopes Criteria, HE Owns the Science

The **PM** is a business-oriented project manager. It translates stakeholder vision into clear requirements and evaluation criteria — defining **WHAT** success looks like.

The **Harness Engineer** is the scientific authority on evaluation. It owns **HOW** to evaluate: scoring rubrics, LLM judge assembly, calibration methodology, and harness topology.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🔒 Information Isolation Is Non-Negotiable

The optimizer-evaluator feedback loop only works if **information asymmetry is maintained**. The Developer must remain blind to evaluation artifacts to prevent reward hacking and overfitting.

The Developer sees EBDR-1 feedback packets and its own LangSmith traces. It never sees rubrics, judge configs, or held-out datasets.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

---

## Agent Roster

> Each agent is a full `create_deep_agent()` graph with its own prompt, tools, memory, skills, and checkpoint namespace.

### Project Manager (PM) — *Pipeline Hub*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Business-oriented orchestrator and requirements owner |
| **Owns** | PRD, eval criteria scoping, artifact organization, stakeholder alignment |
| **Delivers to** | HE, Researcher, Architect, Planner, Developer |
| **Namespace** | `checkpoint_ns = "project_manager"` |

The PM is the **hub** of the pipeline. Specialists return completed work to the PM, and the PM delivers consolidated packages to the next specialist. The PM never performs research, architecture, planning, coding, or evaluation — it coordinates.

---

### Harness Engineer (HE) — *Eval Science Authority*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Scientific iterator, LLM judge authority, phase-gate enforcer |
| **Owns** | Rubrics, LLM judges, calibration, held-out datasets, EBDR-1 feedback |
| **Intervention Points** | Stage 1 (PRD), Stage 2 (Spec), Stage 3 (Plan), Dev Loop (EBDR-1) |
| **Namespace** | `checkpoint_ns = "harness_engineer"` |

<details>
<summary><strong>HE Intervention Stages</strong></summary>

**Stage 1 — PRD Finalization**
- Refine PM's proposed evaluation criteria into a complete evaluation harness
- Determine eval types: binary, binary score, Likert, categories
- Define judge strategy: count, scope, model selection, prompt writing, scoring schema
- Create full synthetic dataset (building on PM's initial examples)
- Calibrate each judge against synthetic data
- **Gate:** PRD cannot be finalized until eval harness is complete and all judges are calibrated

**Stage 2 — Spec Evaluation Coverage**
- Create eval coverage for new components introduced by the Architect
- System prompts, tools, programmatic behaviors, middleware
- Ensure the Developer can effectively hill-climb against new components
- **Gate:** Spec cannot flow to Planner until eval coverage exists for all architect-introduced components

**Stage 3 — Gate Placement**
- Dictate where evaluation gates belong in the development plan
- Create parallel eval plan: which evals run after which dev phases
- Set phase-gate criteria that must be met before progressing

</details>

---

### Researcher — *Deep Ecosystem Research*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Multi-pass web researcher and evidence synthesizer |
| **Owns** | SDK/API discovery, decision-space mapping, evidence bundles |
| **Returns to** | PM (research bundle) |
| **Namespace** | `checkpoint_ns = "researcher"` |

May loop with the Architect via `request_research_from_researcher` when further discovery is needed to inform technical decisions.

---

### Architect — *System Design + Spec*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | System architect and technical specification author |
| **Owns** | Design spec, tool schemas, system prompts, component definitions |
| **Loops with** | Researcher (discovery), HE (Stage 2 eval coverage) |
| **Namespace** | `checkpoint_ns = "architect"` |

Introduces new components that didn't exist at PRD time — triggering HE Stage 2 intervention for evaluation coverage.

---

### Planner — *Implementation Strategy*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Implementation strategist |
| **Owns** | Phased implementation plan with eval break points |
| **Consults** | HE (gate placement), Evaluator (acceptance criteria) |
| **Namespace** | `checkpoint_ns = "planner"` |

The plan marks *when* to evaluate, never *what* or *how*. Eval criteria are invisible to the Planner beyond the public subset.

---

### Developer — *The Optimizer*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Hill-climbing implementation engineer |
| **Owns** | Phase deliverables: code, prompts, tools, UI |
| **Submits to** | Evaluator (pass/fail), HE (EBDR-1 feedback) |
| **Namespace** | `checkpoint_ns = "developer"` |

Works phase-by-phase against the plan. **Completely blind to evaluation artifacts** — only sees EBDR-1 feedback packets and can inspect its own traces in LangSmith.

---

### Evaluator — *Acceptance + Compliance*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Identity** | Acceptance gatekeeper and spec compliance checker |
| **Owns** | Pass/fail findings, spec/plan compliance reports, phase advancement |
| **Coordinates with** | HE (via `coordinate_qa`) |
| **Namespace** | `checkpoint_ns = "evaluator"` |

Validates code against spec and plan. Issues hard pass/fail decisions on phase deliverables. Does not own eval science — that's HE's domain.

---

## Information Isolation Matrix

> This is architecturally critical. The optimizer-evaluator loop only works if information asymmetry is maintained.

| Artifact | PM | HE | Researcher | Architect | Planner | Developer | Evaluator |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| PRD + requirements | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Evaluation criteria (public) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scoring rubrics | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| LLM judge configs | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Held-out eval datasets | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Development plan | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| EBDR-1 feedback packets | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Raw traces (LangSmith) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

---

## Handoff Protocol

All agent-to-agent communication goes through explicit handoff tools. A handoff tool returns `Command(graph=Command.PARENT, goto="process_handoff", update=<payload>)` — the PCG records the handoff and invokes the target agent.

### Naming Convention

```
<verb>_<artifact|phase>_package_to_<role>
```

The tool name reads as a sentence: `deliver_prd_to_harness_engineer`, `submit_phase_to_evaluator`, `consult_harness_engineer_on_gates`.

### Verb Semantics

| Verb | Blocking? | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|
| `deliver` | ✅ | Caller hands off ownership of a pipeline stage |
| `return` | ✅ | Specialist returns completed work |
| `submit` | ✅ | Caller submits work for review or evaluation |
| `consult` | ❌ | Request expert input without transferring ownership |
| `announce` | ❌ | Push intent or heads-up; no deliverable expected back |
| `ask` | ❌ | Ask a question |
| `coordinate` | ❌ | QA agents align with each other |

### Handoff Record Schema

Every handoff is recorded in PCG state:

```python
# Calling agent populates:
project_id: str          # doubles as root thread_id
source_agent: AgentEnum  # project-manager | harness-engineer | researcher | ...
target_agent: AgentEnum  # same enum
reason: ReasonEnum       # deliver | return | submit | consult | announce | coordinate | question
brief: str               # prose summary for the receiving agent
artifact_paths: list     # filesystem paths to artifacts (references, not copies)

# PCG fills in:
handoff_id: str          # unique identifier
langsmith_run_id: str    # trace correlation
status: StatusEnum       # queued | running | completed | failed
created_at: str          # RFC3339 timestamp
```

Middleware dispatches on the `(source_agent, target_agent, reason)` triple to determine which gate logic to apply.

## The Development Loop

The core of the system: the **optimizer-evaluator feedback cycle** that repeats for each phase in the plan.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase Communication Arc

1. **Announce** — Developer announces phase intent to Evaluator and HE (non-blocking)
   > *"I'm starting phase N, will meet these eval criteria"*
   > QA agents respond: *"Agreed, awaiting your submission"*
2. **Execute** — Developer implements the phase
3. **Submit** — Developer submits phase deliverables to both QA agents (blocking)
4. **Feedback** — Developer receives findings from Evaluator + EBDR-1 from HE
5. **Iterate** — Loop continues until both gates pass
6. **Advance** — Move to next phase

### Developer Routing Guide

| Route to | When |
|---|---|
| **Harness Engineer** | Phase fails because eval harness, metric, judge, dataset, calibration, or measurement strategy needs expert review |
| **Evaluator** | Phase needs implementation review, UX verification, design conformance, or hard pass/fail against the plan |
| **PM** | Question changes requirements, success criteria, user-facing behavior, or business priority |

---

## Project Coordination Graph (PCG)

The PCG is the **thin LangGraph orchestration layer** — plumbing, not a brain.

### 3-Node Linear Topology

```
START → receive_user_input → run_agent(PM)
                                  │
                            Agent calls handoff tool
                            Middleware gate fires
                                  │
                            Gate passes → Command.PARENT
                            Gate fails  → revision prompt to agent
                                  │
                            process_handoff → run_agent(target)
                                  │
                            target calls handoff or returns
                                  │
                            process_handoff → run_agent(next)  ← loop
```

| Node | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `receive_user_input` | Accept stakeholder input, write to state for PM |
| `process_handoff` | Record handoff, ensure target namespace, prepare payload |
| `run_agent` | Invoke target mounted Deep Agent under its stable namespace |

**No conditional edges.** The only branching happens *before* `Command.PARENT` reaches the PCG: the middleware hook on the handoff tool decides whether to allow the handoff or return a revision prompt. If the command reaches the PCG, it always flows through `process_handoff` → `run_agent`.

### Phase Gate Middleware

Phase gates are **middleware hooks on handoff tools**, not PCG nodes or conditional edges:

1. Inspect `(source_agent, target_agent, reason, artifact_paths)`
2. Check prerequisites (PRD finalized? Spec approved? Deliverables match plan?)
3. **Pass** → allow `Command.PARENT` through to PCG
4. **Fail** → return revision prompt to calling agent; agent reflects, revises, re-attempts

New phase gates = middleware additions, not PCG topology changes.

---

## Observability

### LangSmith Tracing

Every PCG handoff and Deep Agent invocation is searchable by:

| Field | Scope |
|---|---|
| `project_id` | Set once at PCG init |
| `agent_name` | Auto-propagated via `create_deep_agent(name=...)` |
| `thread_id` | Set once at PCG init |
| `handoff_id` | Handoff-scoped, in handoff records |
| `phase` | Handoff-scoped, in handoff records |
| `from_agent` | Handoff-scoped, in handoff records |
| `to_agent` | Handoff-scoped, in handoff records |

### LangGraph Studio

Local development inspection via `langgraph dev` — graph behavior, thread state, checkpoint namespaces, routing visibility.

### Environment Setup

## Historical Context

This project evolved from the **Long Horizon Meta Harness v1**, which used the PM as the container for all specialist cognition. The v1 architecture is documented in the [original Readme](../Readme.md) and its [diagram](../Harness-Diagram.png).

Key evolution drivers:
- **State isolation** — specialists needed their own checkpoint history, not shared PM context
- **Peer communication** — direct Architect↔Researcher loops without PM pass-through
- **Observable handoffs** — explicit tool calls with structured records, not implicit context passing
- **Middleware extensibility** — new gates as middleware hooks, not topology changes
- **Evaluation separation** — Evaluator role split from HE to separate acceptance testing from eval science
